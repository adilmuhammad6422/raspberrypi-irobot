## ðŸš€ About

This project provides an interface to send commands to the IRobot Create Roomba. There are two parts:
1. server.py
2. client.cpp

The server.py is meant to run on a pc, connect with the client.cpp that runs on the pis. The server can basically send these commands:
- "runDemo x" // where x is the number of seconds to run the demo for. see [roomba_bumper](Roomba/roomba_bumper.cpp) for details.
- "stop" // to stop the roombas.

<!-- TODO: client.py, driver_circle.cpp, roomba_dyna.py, roomba_dynamic.py - are any of these files used? -->

<!-- 
TODO: should we delete this section? It seems to be the same information as below.

## How to connect to Raspberry Pi 3 using ssh
Find the IP Address of the Raspberry Pi (hostname -I) in the command line
  on Macbook terminal type "ssh pi@192.168.x.x" to get into Raspberry Pi 3 command line
  then from there, you can type commands through the terminal 
  -->

## Prerequisites
For fresh installation of a pi see [this](RaspberryOs.md).
### How to SSH (remote connection) into your Raspberry Pi from your computer
1. **Find Pi's IP Address**
   - Connect your Pi to a monitor <!-- TODO: there should be a way to find the ip address without connecting it to a monitor  -->
   - Go into preferences and enable SSH and click "ok" then reboot
   - Get your Raspberry Pi's IP Address
     ```sh
     hostname -I
     ```

3. **SSH into Raspberry Pi**
   - SSH command
     ```sh
     ssh pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP_address>
     ```

## Installation
### Step 1: Setup

1. SSH into your Raspberry Pi's IP

   ```sh
   ssh pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP_address>
   ```
2. Install dependencies, clone repository and compile libarary:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev
     git clone https://github.com/adilmuhammad6422/raspberrypi-irobot.git
     sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
     cd raspberrypi-irobot/Roomba
     mkdir build && cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     sudo make install
     ```

#### Sanity check 1 
Building and running roomba_bumper.cpp to verify pi-roomba communication.
1. Build
     ```sh
     cd raspberrypi-irobot/Roomba
     g++ -o roomba_bumper roomba_bumper.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lcreate
     ```
2. Run. This should make the roomba go forward at 0.2m/s while turning left/right and 180Â° if it touches an obstacle on its left/right or detects a virtual wall, respectively. See [roomba_bumper.cpp](Roomba/roomba_bumper.cpp) for details.
     ```sh
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ./roomba_bumper
     ```

#### Sanity check 2
Building and running client.cpp to verify server-client communication.
```sh
g++ -o client client.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lcreate -pthread
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./client
```
TODO: incomplete, need to add info on how to setup server on pc, and send basic commands to pi and for pi to respond.

<!-- 
TODO:  The below code seems to create a startup file for running roomba_bumper directly? Is this correct? roomba_bumper is supposed to be a testing file to test whether the pi->roomba communication is working.

## Bash Roomba_bumper
```sh
nano ~/start_robot.sh
```

```bash
 #!/bin/bash
 # Navigate to the directory containing your C++ file
 cd raspberrypi-irobot/Roomba

 git checkout -- .
 git pull origin main

 # Compile the C++ file
 g++ -o roomba_bumper roomba_bumper.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lcreate

 # Run the compiled program
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 ./roomba_bumper
```

## Startup
```sh
crontab -e
@reboot /home/pi/start_robot.sh
```

### Running

```sh
chmod +x start_robot.sh
./start_robot.sh
``` -->

### Step 2: Setup startup file
<!-- 
I have created a startup file so that the user does not have to. they just have to link it in the raspberry pi.

1. **create startup file**
   ```sh
   nano ~/start_client.sh
   ```

```bash
 #!/bin/bash
cd $HOME/raspberrypi-irobot/Roomba
g++ -o client client.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lcreate -pthread
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./client
``` -->

To have your pi automatically run client.cpp on startup.
```sh
crontab -e
@reboot /home/pi/raspberrypi-irobot/start_client.sh
```

TODO: verify the startup files.

```sh
chmod +x $HOME/raspberrypi-irobot/start_client.sh
.$HOME/raspberrypi-irobot/start_client.sh
```
