## ðŸš€ About

This project provides an interface to send commands to the IRobot Create Roomba. There are two parts:
1. server.py
2. client.cpp


<!-- 
TODO: should we delete this section? It seems to be the same information as below.

## How to connect to Raspberry Pi 3 using ssh
Find the IP Address of the Raspberry Pi (hostname -I) in the command line
  on Macbook terminal type "ssh pi@192.168.x.x" to get into Raspberry Pi 3 command line
  then from there, you can type commands through the terminal 
  -->

## Prerequisites
For fresh installation of a pi see [this](RaspberryOs.md).
### How to SSH (remote connection) into your Raspberry Pi from your computer
1. **Find Pi's IP Address**
   - Connect your Pi to a monitor <!-- TODO: there should be a way to find the ip address without connecting it to a monitor  -->
   - Go into preferences and enable SSH and click "ok" then reboot
   - Get your Raspberry Pi's IP Address
     ```sh
     hostname -I
     ```

3. **SSH into Raspberry Pi**
   - SSH command
     ```sh
     ssh pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP_address>
     ```

## Installation
### Step 1: Setup

1. SSH into your Raspberry Pi's IP

   ```sh
   ssh pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP_address>
   ```
2. Install dependencies, clone repository and compile libarary:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev
     git clone https://github.com/adilmuhammad6422/raspberrypi-irobot.git
     sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
     cd raspberrypi-irobot/Roomba
     mkdir build && cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     sudo make install
     ```

#### Sanity check 1 
Building and running roomba_bumper.cpp to verify pi-roomba communication.
1. Build
     ```sh
     cd raspberrypi-irobot/Roomba
     g++ -o roomba_bumper roomba_bumper.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lcreate
     ```
2. Run. This should make the roomba go forward at 0.2m/s while turning left/right and 180Â° if it touches an obstacle on its left/right or detects a virtual wall, respectively. See [roomba_bumper.cpp](Roomba/roomba_bumper.cpp) for details.
     ```sh
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ./roomba_bumper
     ```

#### Sanity check 2
Building and running client.cpp to verify server-client communication.
```sh
g++ -o client client.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lcreate -pthread
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./client
```
TODO: incomplete, need to add info on how to setup server on pc, and send basic commands to pi and for pi to respond. is this done on the pi in the first place?

<!-- 
TODO:  The below code seems to create a startup file for running roomba_bumper directly? Is this correct? roomba_bumper is supposed to be a testing file to test whether the pi->roomba communication is working.

## Bash Roomba_bumper
```sh
nano ~/start_robot.sh
```

```bash
 #!/bin/bash
 # Navigate to the directory containing your C++ file
 cd raspberrypi-irobot/Roomba

 git checkout -- .
 git pull origin main

 # Compile the C++ file
 g++ -o roomba_bumper roomba_bumper.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lcreate

 # Run the compiled program
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 ./roomba_bumper
```

## Startup
```sh
crontab -e
@reboot /home/pi/start_robot.sh
```

### Running

```sh
chmod +x start_robot.sh
./start_robot.sh
``` -->

### Step 2: Setup startup file
<!-- 
I have created a startup file so that the user does not have to. they just have to link it in the raspberry pi.

1. **create startup file**
   ```sh
   nano ~/start_client.sh
   ```

```bash
 #!/bin/bash
cd $HOME/raspberrypi-irobot/Roomba
g++ -o client client.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lcreate -pthread
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./client
``` -->

To have your pi automatically run client.cpp on startup.
```sh
crontab -e
@reboot /home/pi/raspberrypi-irobot/start_client.sh
```

TODO: verify the startup files.

```sh
chmod +x $HOME/raspberrypi-irobot/start_client.sh
.$HOME/raspberrypi-irobot/start_client.sh
```
