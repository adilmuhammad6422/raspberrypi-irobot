## TODOs
### Software Todos:
- [ ] meet with Nathan to ask about the commented todos in the readme
- [ ] Server and Client are prone to errors:
   - [ ] if roomba restarts, client does not reconnect 
   - [ ] if client cannot connect to roomba, client should send error message to server, try to restart itself `sudo reboot`.
   - [ ] the server should be able to ping all the pis, irrespective of whether they are connected to it or not. the server should be able to ping all the Pi IP addresses and give a list of which pi is disconnected to the router.
- [x] readme todos: Sanity check 2 - connect with server, server should send "hello", client should send back "hello OK"
- [x] readme todos: verify startup file
- [x] if demo is running, how can we stop it? interrupt added, needs to be verified.
### Physical Todos:
- [x] All 9 pis have updated OS, installed software
- [x] All 9 pis can communicate with roomba (Sanity Check 1)
   - [x] Go forward
   - [x] Left/Right bumber
   - [x] Virtual wall
- [x] All 9 pis can communicate with server (Sanity Check 2)
- [ ] Run all 9 pis together on final testbed

## ðŸš€ About
This project provides an interface to send commands to the IRobot Create Roomba. There are two parts:
1. server.py
2. client.cpp

The server.py is meant to run on a pc, connect with the client.cpp that runs on the pis. The server can basically send these commands:
- "runDemo x" // where x is the number of seconds to run the demo for. see [roomba_bumper](Roomba/roomba_bumper.cpp) for details.
- "stop" // to stop the roombas.

See [Usage](#usage).

<!-- TODO: client.py, driver_circle.cpp, roomba_dyna.py, roomba_dynamic.py - are any of these files used? -->

TODO: should we delete this section? It seems to be the same information as below.

## How to connect to Raspberry Pi 3 using ssh
Find the IP Address of the Raspberry Pi (hostname -I) in the command line
  on Macbook terminal type "ssh pi@192.168.x.x" to get into Raspberry Pi 3 command line
  then from there, you can type commands through the terminal 
  -->

## Prerequisites for Installation
For fresh installation of a pi see [this](RaspberryOs.md).
### How to SSH (remote connection) into your Raspberry Pi from your computer
1. If your Pi does not have SSH enabled:
   - Connect your Pi to a monitor
   - Go into preferences and enable SSH and click "ok" then reboot
2. Find Pi's IP Address
   - One way to find the ip address of the pi is to use the router's homepage.
   <!-- - Another way is to connect Get your Raspberry Pi's IP Address
     ```sh
     hostname -I
     ``` -->
3. SSH into Raspberry Pi, password: raspberry
     ```sh
     ssh pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP_address>
     ```

## Installation
### Step 1: Setup

1. SSH into your Raspberry Pi's IP, password: raspberry

   ```sh
   ssh pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP_address>
   ```
2. Clone repository
3. run setup.sh to install dependencies, compile libarary, and compile client.cpp
    

<!-- #### Sanity check 1 
Building and running roomba_bumper.cpp to verify pi-roomba communication.
1. Build
     ```sh
     cd raspberrypi-irobot/Roomba
     g++ -o roomba_bumper roomba_bumper.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lcreate
     ```
2. Run. This should make the roomba go forward at 0.2m/s while turning left/right and 180Â° if it touches an obstacle on its left/right or detects a virtual wall, respectively. See [roomba_bumper.cpp](Roomba/roomba_bumper.cpp) for details.
     ```sh
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ./roomba_bumper
     ```

#### Sanity check 2
Building and running client.cpp to verify server-client communication.
```sh
g++ -o client client.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lcreate -pthread
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./client
```
TODO: incomplete, need to add info on how to setup server on pc, and send basic commands to pi and for pi to respond. -->

<!-- 
TODO:  The below code seems to create a startup file for running roomba_bumper directly? Is this correct? roomba_bumper is supposed to be a testing file to test whether the pi->roomba communication is working.

## Bash Roomba_bumper
```sh
nano ~/start_robot.sh
```

```bash
 #!/bin/bash
 # Navigate to the directory containing your C++ file
 cd raspberrypi-irobot/Roomba

 git checkout -- .
 git pull origin main

 # Compile the C++ file
 g++ -o roomba_bumper roomba_bumper.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lcreate

 # Run the compiled program
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 ./roomba_bumper
```

## Startup
```sh
crontab -e
@reboot /home/pi/start_robot.sh
```

### Running

```sh
chmod +x start_robot.sh
./start_robot.sh
``` -->

### Step 2: Setup startup file
<!-- 
I have created a startup file so that the user does not have to. they just have to link it in the raspberry pi.

1. **create startup file**
   ```sh
   nano ~/start_client.sh
   ```

```bash
 #!/bin/bash
cd $HOME/raspberrypi-irobot/Roomba
g++ -o client client.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lcreate -pthread
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./client
``` -->

To have your pi automatically run client.cpp on startup.
<!-- ```sh
chmod +x $HOME/raspberrypi-irobot/start_client.sh
# .$HOME/raspberrypi-irobot/start_client.sh
``` -->
```sh
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "@reboot sleep 10 && /home/pi/client") | crontab -
```

TODO: verify the startup files.


## Usage
Now that the pi is setup do this:
0. Startup the linksys router, connect your laptop to it. youll get the server ip. For the linksys router, the first assigned ip is 192.168.1.110
1. Run server.py on pc, making sure it is connected to the router
2. Connect the pi with the battery, turn off by double pressing the power button. Connect the pi with the roomba with the cables
3. Turn on the roomba first. Power light should flicker red and yellow then remain on yellow. 
4. Turn on the batteries of the pis (single click). This should turn on the pi. You should hear a beep sound from the roomba, the power light should go off and see on the server that the pis are connecting. 
5. Send the command "runDemo 60" via the server. All the roombas should start moving forward at 0.2m/s for 60 seconds while turning left/right if it bumps into anything on its left/right and turning 180Â° if it senses a virtual wall. 
   1. Optionally, within the 60s you can send the command "stop" from the server. All the roombas should stop momentarily.


## Hardware issues
- if after connecting everything, turning the roomba on first, then the pi, waiting 10s and then you hear a second beep but the light stays on -> pi cannot communicate with the roomba. likely an issue of the wiring.
